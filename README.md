# Recent Recipe
Do you hate mass crafting? Me too, so I made a small client side fix for it.  
Recent recipe allows the user to press the spacebar just after crafting something to re-craft the same item again.  
Shift + Spacebar also allows the user to craft stacks at a time instead of just one item.

Recent Recipe also adds w + shift + click which will place an item directly into their inventory crafting grid. This is especially useful for converting iron blocks and such.
